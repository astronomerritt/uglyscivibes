Basic functionality:

1. need stoplist of words (TODO: update total list)
2. Correlate that with some example sentiment analysis output  (TODO: Luna write vibe_check())
3. Visualize (TODO: Mireya get watercolors working)

Advanced:
1. correlate abbreviations with actual terms 
(Ultrahot Jupiters = UJ's, UltraLight Dark Matter = ULDM....)
2. re-train sentiment analysis models on more 
astro-colloquial materials (astro Twitter, astrobites,..
