Basic functionality:
1. Watercolors work! get functional version of plotting to work in the demo jupyter
2. Make an overall function to plot vibes?

Advanced:
1. correlate abbreviations with actual terms 
(Ultrahot Jupiters = UJ's, UltraLight Dark Matter = ULDM....) [TODO: Steph --> mostly done!]
2. re-train sentiment analysis models on more 
astro-colloquial materials (astro Twitter, astrobites,..) [Possibly TODO: Luna]
3. other visualizations?
