Basic functionality:

1. Read in Abstract (TODO: edge cases (empty abstracts?))
2. need stoplist of words (TODO: update total list)
3. Get unique counts-list for every word in Abstract (done!)
4. Correlate that with some example sentiment analysis output  (TODO: Luna write vibe_check())
5. Visualize (TODO: Mireya get watercolors working)

Advanced:
1. correlate abbreviations with actual terms 
(Ultrahot Jupiters = UJ's, UltraLight Dark Matter = ULDM....)
2. re-train sentiment analysis models on more 
astro-colloquial materials (astro Twitter, astrobites,..
