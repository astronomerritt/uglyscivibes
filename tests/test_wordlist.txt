self
gravitating
quantum
matter
may
exist
in
a
wide
range
of
cosmological
and
astrophysical
settings
from
the
very
early
universe
through
to
present
day
boson
stars
such
quantum
matter
arises
in
a
number
of
different
theories
including
the
peccei
quinn
axion
and
ultralight
uldm
or
fuzzy
dark
matter
scenarios
we
consider
the
dynamical
evolution
of
perturbations
to
the
spherically
symmetric
soliton
the
ground
state
solution
to
the
schrödinger
poisson
system
common
to
all
these
scenarios
we
construct
the
eigenstates
of
the
schrödinger
equation
holding
the
gravitational
potential
fixed
to
its
ground
state
value
we
see
that
the
eigenstates
qualitatively
capture
the
properties
seen
in
full
uldm
simulations
including
the
soliton
breathing
mode
the
random
walk
of
the
soliton
center
and
quadrupolar
distortions
of
the
soliton
we
then
show
that
the
time
evolution
of
the
gravitational
potential
and
its
impact
on
the
perturbations
can
be
well
described
within
the
framework
of
time
dependent
perturbation
theory
as
an
illustrative
example
we
apply
our
formalism
to
a
synthetic
uldm
halo
we
find
the
soliton
core
accounts
for
approximately
30
of
the
halos
wave
function
throughout
its
evolution
with
higher
modes
accounting
for
the
halos
navarro
frenk
white
skirt
and
relatively
little
mixing
between
different
ℓ
modes
our
results
provide
a
new
analytic
approach
to
understanding
the
evolution
of
these
systems
as
well
as
possibilities
for
faster
approximate
simulations
though
the
lambda
cold
dark
matter
model
has
seen
a
fantastic
concurrence
of
observational
data
and
computational
simulations
at
scales
lt10
kpc
tensions
appear
at
smaller
scales
simulations
predict
centrally
peaked
haloes
and
large
numbers
of
both
light
dark
matter
haloes
and
high
luminosity
satellite
galaxies
associated
with
more
massive
sub
haloes
at
the
same
time
observations
suggest
centrally
cored
haloes
and
fail
to
detect
sufficient
numbers
of
the
smallest
haloes
corresponding
to
dwarf
galaxies
or
high
luminosity
satellite
galaxies
these
gaps
in
theory
and
observation
are
known
as
the
core
cusp
problem
missing
satellites
problem
and
too
big
to
fail
problem
respectively
though
some
of
the
underlying
problems
can
be
softened
through
baryonic
effects
they
suggest
a
deviation
from
the
cold
dark
matter
model
on
small
cosmological
scales
one
proposed
solution
to
this
discrepancy
is
ultra
light
dark
matter
uldm
an
axion
like
dark
matter
candidate
of
mass
10sup

ev
the
quantum
nature
of
this
low
mass
axion
naturally
suppresses
structure
formation
at
small
scales
via
the
heisenberg
uncertainty
principle
thus
coring
out
the
central
profiles
of
dark
matter
haloes
furthermore
the
power
spectrum
of
uldm
density
perturbations
is
suppressed
at
small
masses
predicting
fewer
satellite
haloes
and
their
luminous
galaxies
at
the
same
time
uldm
acts
exactly
like
cold
dark
matter
on
distances
much
larger
than
its
own
de
broglie
wavelength
thus
maintaining
the
predictive
nature
of
cold
dark
matter
on
large
scales
computational
studies
of
these
effects
require
high
resolution
on
small
scales
where
the
discrepancies
between
uldm
and
cold
dark
matter
are
greatest
one
example
of
a
pseudo
scalar
solver
to
study
dark
matter
called
pyultralight
was
put
forth
by
our
collaborators
at
the
uauckland
in
2018
we
have
since
created
a
sister
code
called
chapelultra
utilizing
the
same
algorithm
but
introducing
greater
parallelism
through
the
use
of
chapel
a
language
developed
by
cray
industries
this
has
resulted
in
a
speed
up
of
almost
an
order
of
magnitude
making
chapelultra
one
of
the
faster
uldm
solvers
currently
available
this
allows
us
to
quickly
and
portably
study
the
effects
of
the
simulation
itself
on
predicted
profiles
of
virialized
haloes
including
contrasting
periodic
vs
non
periodic
boundary
conditions
and
compare
our
uldm
and
nfw
profile
fits
to
both
observational
data
and
other
commercially
available
fdm
solvers
in
doing
so
we
hope
to
gain
a
robust
understanding
of
our
solver
which
we
can
then
use
to
help
rule
uldm
in
or
out

a
viable
dark
matter
candidate

ultralight
dark

uldm
is
a
light
axion
like
dark

candidate
whose
dynamics
are
governed
by
the
schrodinger
poisson
system
the
ground

solution
of
this
system
is
a
spherically

soliton
however
its
shape
is
incompatible
with

constraints
on

instead
uldm
haloes
which
have
a

core
and
asymptote
to
an

profile
at

can
be
created
through

of
ground

in
this
work
we
create
such
haloes
using
our
chplultra
code
to
perform
mergers
of
two
initial
solitons
which
we
parametrize
by
initial

their

and

we
further
model
the

of
the

and
investigate

timescales
for
resultant

both
as

of

finally
